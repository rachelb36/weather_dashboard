## Description

### Weather Dashboard that gives user weather outlook for multiple cities.

- The user enters a search for a city, when the user hits the "search" button they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- The user is presented with the current and future weather conditions of the city, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- The user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
